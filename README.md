### Why should I use Artik.js instead of vanilla javascript ?
* ARTIK has been made with simplicity and compatibility in mind. ARTIK.js is a very lite javascript library that is and will always be compatible with old and new browsers.

* ARTIK is basically Jquery, but modern, and very lite.

* It's Easy to use, simplicity is key :key:

* Artik is completely modern, free and open source. 


### What's the progress report ?

|     **Arrays**     |   **Booleans**   | **DOM**     |
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: |
|  Completed ‚úîÔ∏è | In progress ‚òëÔ∏è   | In progress ‚òëÔ∏è    |


### It's time to ditch Jquery !

* In many ways thanks to jQuery, jQuery itself is no longer needed. Switch to Artik üòâ üßä

### A note for non developpers or beginners

* if you make changes to Artik.js either by accident or intentionnaly don't forget to compile it again.


## Available DOM functions

* Instead of using **$** has the Query selector we decided to use **pg** 


| **DOM**     |
| :------------- |
|  pg('#selector').on(event, callback) | 
|  .setAttribute(attr, value) | 
|  .val() returns the value | 
|  .keyup() | 
|  .hide() | 
|  .html() | 


### An Example
```javascript
pg('#inputEmail3').on('keyup', function(){
   var total = pg('#inputEmail3').val()
   pg('#amountFinal').setAttribute('value', `${total}`);
})
```
